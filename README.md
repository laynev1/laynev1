- 👋 Hi, I’m @laynev1
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Linux and using premade software to operate a functional business.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning which distro I find most suitable for my interests.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small & easy projects for now!  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm just winging all this, I don't learn in VMs because I'd rather nuke my system until I can figure out otherwise.
